            <h1>Truman Today</h1>
            <p>
              It was official. Truman had become the premiere public institution in Missouri after decades of hard work from students and faculty. The school continued to provide students across the state, and soon other states, with
              a fulfilling and diverse education. Any graduate of NEMO was known to be well-rounded and well-educated, leading to yet another, and as of now the final, rebrand for Joseph Baldwin's institution. Ths school
              gained the name <b>Truman State University</b> in 1996 to distinguish itself from other regional universities; "Truman" was taken from the Missouri-born former President Harry Truman, and signifies that 
              its' students are the best and brightest from across the midwest. Home to several nationally renowned programs, and a stellar alumni track record, Truman receives constant praise in college-ranking lists from 
              any and every source. For those that still consider TSU to be a regional university, they have no choice other than to place Truman amongst the very best in the country in the category. While another name change seems 
              unlikely at this point, Truman State is constantly updating and improving its' curriculum in order to provide students across the midwest with a premiere education in the field of liberal arts and sciences.
