          <h1>Academic Excellence</h1>
          <p>
            Since 1986, Truman State has been the premier public academic institution in the state of Missouri, and has lived up to the reputation. They consistently rank amongst the best in the state in both their accounting, 
            and nursing programs; although these two may be their strongest on paper, the other 53 programs that they offer are all incredibly competitive as well, thanks to the dedicated and passionate faculty. Truman State 
            separates their majors into 5 schools; Arts and Letters, Business, Health Sciences and Education, Science and Mathematics, and Social and Cultural Studies. Since Truman is a school of liberal arts and sciences, you
            will be involved in programs consisting of individuals from each and every major during your time as a student. And if none of those major clusters jump out at you, you can always design your own with an 
            Interdisciplinary Studies approach, where you can work with faculty members to create your own degree. Even though it is a small school, you'll be able to find your place academically, no matter where your interests lie.
