          <h1>Regional University</h1>
          <p>
            Although the University planned to maintain an emphasis on education, their student body began to expand beyond those strictly interested in teaching. In 1968, the school decided once again to rebrand to keep up with their 
            current state, and became <b>Northeast Missouri State College</b>. This name signified their expansion into a regional school, which increased the student population and number of programs. This new mission would 
            last for years, although much of it was under the name <b>Northeast Missouri State University</b>, or NEMO, which was updated in 1972. This regional name-based era also holds the final steps that led to Truman's current 
            dynamic; in 1985, NEMO was designated as Missouri's first and only public liberal arts and sciences university. This meant that although Truman still had a regional name, they had become a state-wide college. This
            led to a stint of academic reorganization that marked the beginning of the current era.
