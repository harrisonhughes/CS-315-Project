          <h1>Normal School Era</h1>
          <p>From its' inception in 1867 to 1918, Truman State operated under the monicker of a "normal school", meaning the university was essentially a regional school to train teachers. Joseph Baldwin is the 
            forefather of the school, and was a household name in the world of education prior to the opening of what was originally the <b>North Missouri Normal and Commercial School</b>. A year later, in 1968, 
            the school dropped the "commercial" from the name to become <b>North Missouri Normal School</b>. Not much is known about these first few years. 2 years later, The Missouri General Assembly designated
            the school as the first public teachers college in Missouri, which came with another rename; the <b>First District Normal School</b>. This name stuck, and Joseph Baldwin's school would exist for another
            48 years with this university name.
