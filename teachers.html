          <h1>Teacher's College</h1>
          <p>Although the mission that Joseph Baldwin started (to train teachers in the art of education), the university felt it needed a more modern name. After 51 years as a Normal School, the University was branded
            <b>Northeast Missouri State Teachers College</b> in 1918. This further emphasized their role as a public, regional university meant to train the next generation of educational specialists. Although this name
            was strong in purpose, the name didn't stick as well as the administrators had hoped; the school was commonly referred to as <em>Kirksville State University</em> during this 50 year run as a teachers college.
            Soon after this rebranding, the quad area on campus that we know today was created; what used to be a lake in the center of campus became a wooded and grassy area, after the water was pumped to attempt to 
            extinguish the blaze of the great Baldwin Hall fire of 1924. They were unsuccessful: the school was left with no Baldwin Hall, and no lake. But, as Truman students still do today, they rebuilt and began again.
